## About The Project

![Screen Shot](logo.jpg)

This project is about the classification of different lung diseases like COVID, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and Lung Cancer using chest-Xrays and CT scan images.

## Dataset
Dataset Used:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
2. https://www.kaggle.com/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia
3. https://www.kaggle.com/jtiptj/chest-xray-pneumoniacovid19tuberculosis
4. https://www.kaggle.com/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images
5. https://www.kaggle.com/hamdallak/the-iqothnccd-lung-cancer-dataset

## Built With

To build this project I followed the below approach.

Step 1:

Data Preprocessing: In data preprocessing I had used different image processing techniques like noise removing, contrast adjusting using CLAHE, etc to enhance the image quality

Step 2:

Training: To train I had used different transfer learning models like resnet52,vgg19,vgg16,inception,exception,mobilenet,inceptionresnet, etc. I had done fine-tuning on different models to increase the accuracy. After I had done the ensembling of different model as every models have their own methods to extract the feature from images

Step 3:

Deployment: For deployment, I had used flask and Heroku

## Getting Started


### Installation

To run this application in your local system do the following steps
1. Download zip file in your local system
2. Open Command prompt
3. Run python app.py

## Usage

To use this application you need to take an X-ray/Ct scan image in JPEG/PNG/JPG format then insert it into our application you will get a result whether you have which diseases or you are normal.
